## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not authenticated" errors**
- Ensure you have Spotify Premium
- Check that your Client ID and Secret are correct
- Verify your redirect URI matches exactly (use `https://127.0.0.1:7001/Home/SpotifyCallback`)

**Audio files not playing**
- Confirm MP3/WAV files are in `wwwroot/audio/`
- Check browser console for loading errors
- Ensure files are properly named (filenames are case-sensitive)
- For announcement audio, verify filenames match expected naming conventions

**Playlist loading issues**
- Verify playlist URLs are public or you have access
- Check that playlist IDs are extracted correctly
- Ensure Spotify app permissions include playlist access

**Playback not working**
- Make sure Spotify app isn't already playing music
- Check that the HockeyDJ device appears in your Spotify connect devices
- Refresh the page if the Spotify Web SDK doesn't initialize

**Announcements not working**
- For home team: Ensure audio files exist with correct names in `wwwroot/audio/`
- For away team: Ensure your browser supports Web Speech API (Chrome recommended)
- Verify roster format is `Number:Name` with colon separator

**Priority Queue issues**
- Queued songs only play when clicking "Play Random" on a playlist
- Goal Horn celebrations bypass the priority queue
- Clear browser cache if queue display doesn't update
